## 🏛 What Is Clicker Empire?

**Clicker Empire: Rise of Infinity (CEROF)** is an evolving idle civilization simulator built in Unity.

You start with a small settlement.  
You harvest finite resources.  
You automate production.  
You balance your economy.  
You expand your civilization.

But this is not just a clicker game.

It is a systemic economic simulation where every resource affects another — and imbalance creates pressure.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Features

- 🌲 Finite resource nodes (Wood, Stone, Food, Gold)
- 🏗 Building placement on isometric grid
- ⚙ Automated production via centralized GameTick system
- 📊 Resource caps & economic tradeoffs
- 🧠 Harmony system (derived systemic stability)
- 🗺 Expandable architecture (City → World → Planet → Galaxy)

---

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

Clicker Empire is built around five pillars:

- **Living Economy** – Nothing is infinite.
- **Spatial Strategy** – Placement matters.
- **Systemic Balance** – Harmony over brute force growth.
- **Layered Architecture** – Micro to macro simulation.
- **Civilizational Evolution** – Multiple development paths.

The goal is long-term evolution:

Idle Incremental → Strategic City Builder → Civilization Simulator → Galactic Economy System
